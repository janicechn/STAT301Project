# Car Price Prediction Based on Consumer Traits
## STAT 301 Project
### By Janice Chan, Elias Khan, Davis Li, Daniel Yuan

## Introduction
One of our team members, Davis, is studying business and works at a Honda retailer selling cars. We found this car dataset from Kaggle that stood out to us because it is directly correlated to what we’re interested in. As a salesman, it is important to gauge how much a client is willing to pay for a car to make the best suggestions. This dataset helps us answer that question by providing input variables (demographics/attributes of a buyer) to predict the response variable (the price they paid for the car).

## Question:
The key question we inquire is: “what attributes of a buyer can best predict how much a buyer is willing to pay for a car?”. As our project is based on prediction, we want to predict: “based on attributes of a buyer/consumer, how much would they be willing to pay for a car?”.

## Dataset:
“Car Sales Price Prediction” from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashpaloswal/ann-car-sales-price-prediction (Yashpal, n.d.), consisting of 500 observations.

The input variables are customer name, customer email, country, gender, age, annual salary, credit card debt, and net worth.

The response variable is the amount paid for a car by the buyer.
